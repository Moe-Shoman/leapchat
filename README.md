# LeapChat

LeapChat is an ephemeral chat application.  LeapChat uses
[miniLock](https://minilock.io) for challenge/response-based
authentication. This app also enables users to create chat rooms,
invite others to said rooms (via a special URL with a passphrase at
the end of it that is used to generate a miniLock keypair), and of
course send (encrypted) messages to the other chat room participants.


## Security Features

- The server cannot see anyone's usernames

- Users can "leap" from one room to the next so that if an adversary
  clicks on an old invite link, it cannot be used to join the room
  - (Feature coming soon!)

- [Very secure headers](https://securityheaders.io/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leapchat.org&followRedirects=on)
  thanks to [gosecure](https://github.com/cryptag/gosecure).

- TODO (many more)
